audacious2clip is a quick and dirty bash script, which will copy the current now playing song to the clipboard.
The script was mostly meant for myself, but I thought I'd share it as it can be useful for someone. Have fun, and do anything
you want to do with it.

It requires xclip to work. It also uses audtool to get its' info.

If you want to use this in a IRC client via the /exec command, then you may want to remove the "| xclip" part from the script :)
